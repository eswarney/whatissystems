# What Is Systems? (Homepage)

```
Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo
```

The homepage will be the initial point of contact with the user, and thus as such should recognize the purpose of visiting this website, and provide them with a concise summary of SYDE.

```
S Y D E, What is Systems? Just ask me!
```

The first blurb should be a statement about who the site is for, and what questions it sets out to answer:

*Do we spin these questions to fit any user, or tailor to the potential student? Needs improved wording*

```
Whether you are potential student, a curious employer, or anyone in between, join us on our Systems Design Engineering journey to learn:
What is Systems Design?
Will this program be the right fit for me?
Where do students apply their skills?

## What is Systems Design Engineering?

### What do we learn?

First blurb should talk generally, taking a route similar to the official descriptions on the website and in brochures.

```
As a discipline, Systems Design Engineering uses systems theory as the mathematical basis for analyzing and modelling the world, and design thinking as the insight needed to to solve problems while keeping the users in focus. The engineering problems that we tackle are commonly interdisciplinary, and require strong decision making and leadership skills.
```

Second blurb should talk about the math/systems side of things (Link to Systems page).

```
First and foremost, this is an acredited engineering program, and as such we learn a lot of theory in math and physics, along with other applied knowledge in hardware and software. The first two years are primarily about accumulating knowledge about the real world through physics, and acquiring the math skills to do modeling and analysis. Then systems theory comes in, which allows us to model complex, real-world problems as a system using mathematical computations.
```

Third blurb should talk more about design and real-world applications of our skills (Link to design page).

```
Design is a complementary skillset that takes the form of proven processes for planning, creating, and executing designed solutions to engineering problems. It is the perfect complement to engineering, and one that is rarely taught outright to engineers. Knowing human-centered design processes allows an engineer to think not just about the technical solution they are fascilitating, but about all users and stakeholders who will interact with the solution, along with their individual requirements.
```

Final blurb should talk about the skills that we learn, and connected courses. I am thinking a chart relating skills to courses, and the courses can be clicked on for a short description of the course. Additionally mention the flexibility in electives, and link to the page on specialization.

```
The skills that we learn in Systems Design Engineering are inherently interdisciplinary, as they can be applied to almost any problem in a wide variety of fields. The program also has flexibility to take many technical electives, so that the student can specialize in their desired field of interest. The core courses that all Systems Design students take are listed below, broken down by area of focus.

For future students:
Click through the table of core courses to explore the subjects that you would be learning in Systems Design. Consider if you enjoy the general topics enough to study them for the next 5 years, we want you to be happy with your choice of degree! We recruted students to write the descriptions, so as to cut through all the formal language found in the school's descriptions.

| Design    | Math                                     | Physics  | Software/Hardware |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| SYDE 101L | SYDE 111: Fundamental Engineering Math 1 - Covers all of high school Calculus, and introduces infinite series which let us make estimations of functions to a certain accuracy. | SYDE 181 | SYDE 121          |
| SYDE 161  | SYDE 113: Matrices and Linear Systems - All the vectors that you may have done in high school, but now in matrix (array) form! Plus learn about cool curves, binary and floating point numbers, and why e^iÏ€ = -1. | SYDE 182 | SYDE 192          |
| SYDE 162  | SYDE 112: Fundamental Engineering Math 2 - Go over integration (sum up an infinite number of infinitely small things, and magic occurs), and start multivariable/vector calculus (who knew 3D functions could be so much fun!). | SYDE 283 | SYDE 223          |
| SYDE 261  | SYDE 114: Numerical and Applied Calculus - First play around more with matrices, then start using differential equations to model a draining tank and radioactive decay. | SYDE 285 | SYDE 292          |
| SYDE 262  | SYDE 211                                 | SYDE 286 | SYDE 352          |
| SYDE 361  | SYDE 212                                 | SYDE 351 |                   |
| SYDE 362  | SYDE 252                                 | SYDE 381 |                   |
| SYDE 461  | SYDE 311                                 | SYDE 383 |                   |
| SYDE 462  | SYDE 312                                 |          |                   |
|           | SYDE 411                                 |          |                   |

**TODO:** Write/gather descriptions of all the courses (should be short, easily digestible descriptions) as well as any pertinent links to interesting projects to come out of design courses (or labs, etc). Ex/ we write 1A/1B, get a 2019 to do 2A-3A, and find a 2017 to do 3B-4A.
