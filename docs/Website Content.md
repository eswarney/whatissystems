# What Is Systems? (Homepage)

```
Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo
```

The homepage will be the initial point of contact with the user, and thus as such should recognize the purpose of visiting this website, and provide them with a concise summary of SYDE.

```
S Y D E, What is Systems? Just ask me!
```

The first blurb should be a statement about who the site is for, and what questions it sets out to answer:

```
Whether you are potential student, a curious employer, or anyone in between, join us on our Systems Design Engineering journey to learn:
What is Systems Design?
Will this program be the right fit for me?
Where do students apply their skills?
```

## What is Systems Design Engineering?

### What do we learn?

First blurb should talk generally, taking a route similar to the official descriptions on the website and in brochures.

Second blurb should talk about the math/systems side of things (Link to Systems page).

Third blurb should talk more about design and real-world applications of our skills (Link to design page).

Final blurb should talk about the skills that we learn, and connected courses. I am thinking a chart relating skills to courses, and the courses can be clicked on for a short description of the course. Additionally mention the flexibility in electives, and link to the page on specialization.

#### Design?

1: Talk about what design is in this context (not visual design, but design thinking)

- Embed a YouTube video that nicely covers human centered design
- IDEO: What is Human Centered Design? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=musmgKEPY2o

2: Talk about proven methods and their sources (Design Sprints, Human Factors Analysis)

3: Examples of where design thinking can be found in real work (link to projects, )

4: Want to learn more? Examples of relevant websites, books, etc

- IDEO Design Kit - http://www.designkit.org/
- Happy City (book) - thorough application of design thinking in city design https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiQUzOnA5w (TedTalk)
- Why Design Should Include Everyone (TedTalk) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD_SLJG7oi8
- Sprint (Book) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MU4c5_xKxS8
- Thinking Fast and Slow (Book)

#### Systems?

1: Why we take so many math and physics courses -> systems modelling

2: The elephant parable story

3: about integrating all our knowledge together and dealing with ambiguity

4: outline the base tenants of systems thinking,
