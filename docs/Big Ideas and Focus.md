# Big Ideas and Focus

## What is Systems Design Engineering?

### What do we learn?

- What courses define the program/what courses do we take
- You learn many skills (circuits, product design, project management, programming, human factors analysis, etc)
- This is engineering, we do lot of math (be warned if you are more on the visual/user interface side of things)
- More of a theoretical/abstract (math, analysis, modelling) course rather than hands on (bar design projects) - specifically in first years before electives set in - like UofT EngSci (research pls), but employers know what it is
- Are there real-world applications for the skills you are learning?
- Highlight information for future students specifically, that way we can deliver content for everyone, and still focus on tips just for them!

#### Design?

- Focus on why design and engineering go together like bread and butter
- What do you actually learn in design courses
- The intersection of engineering and art and psychology
- Learn a proven process (human-centered design methods) that can be used anywhere
- Relevance to the workplace in any discipline
- The projects!! - group work, link to examples page

#### Systems?

- Systems modelling, aka why we take the most math courses of any engineering undergrad at waterloo
- Systems modelling is a mathematical method of analyzing complex problems using systems of equations, computations, etc to model real world problems.
- We are not necessarily the “easier engineering program with better job prospects”
- Course descriptions, we get base knowledge and then take courses to model interactions?
- About integrating knowledge together, dealing with ambiguity

### Is this a general engineering program?

- We may not fit the mental model of your typical engineer, but we are legitimate and not at all scam. -> generalist talk in the next question
  - This is why SYDE is so hard to explain, it does not fit into a preconceived niche of what engineering is or should be
- You learn about engineering broadly, but can learn about your area of interest deeply.
- We are not a general engineering program, but "everyone is extremely curious and willing to learn a wide range of topics"
- You must be a proactive person: you must go beyond school in your field of interest to have great career success, and your broad knowledge will provide career freedom
- Talk about the **tradeoff**: if you are highly passionate about a single field, it would be advantageous to pursue that specific field - **systems is not for everybody**
- A holistic discipline, a way of deciding what you want to do while working on a practical and challenging career path

### Can I specialize?

- **Talk about what you can specialize in**, but also that it may be difficult to fit some options into your schedule etc
- Discuss the jack of all trades vs. specialization issue (highly valued expert generalists, and dedicated specialists)You will be an expert at what YOU choose later on
- Challenges you may face if you do not specialize, etc - hard to make it in non-software fields, difficult switching co-op types halfway through
- Examples of how people got into their areas of focus
- Last 2-3 co-ops should be used to hone your skills for your specific field of interest
- **It is okay to switch** if it is just not for you. A happy passionate student, regardless of field, will do better than a SYDE student

### Program History

- This leads to discussion of why Systems was created, and it's credibility as an established program

## What makes a Systems Student?

### SYDE student characteristics

- SYDE is for well rounded, curious and proactive students who are willing to make their career a "choose your own path" adventure. There are more doors open, but only if you work hard to compete with everyone else who is more specialized. This hard work + more social development + well rounded-ness makes it a very high reward program job-search wise for students who fit these criteria.
- For ambitious, independent thinkers - hesitant to put a box around yourself
- If you're an ambitious go-getter who loves engineering and just problem solving in general, SYDE is for you. If you're interested in more than one field and want to be a skilled generalist who's able to get things done, SYDE is for you.
- Many leaders - point to involvement, things you can get involved in, etc
- “I knew the type of problems I wanted to solve, but did not know how to solve them”, “felt I needed a comprehensive understanding of engineering and a highly customizable degree”
- Both intelligent and socially aware, can handle ambiguity, has the confidence to define their own role in the job market
- Very interesting to incorporate parts of MacGregor’s Persona Briefs, could even make it an interactive quiz type of display?
- **Avoid misalignment between courses, co-op jobs, and career interest**

### The community

- Focus on the caring professors, upper-years, and classmates, so much support
- Link the Class of 2017 profile project (learn about this section, and others such as employment with hard data)
- Known as the social engineering program, leads to discussion of having classes togethers, the social activities, etc - “When you talk about our classes, co-op jobs, social events and traditions students from other engineering departments get jealous.”
- The class bonding experience because of our small size, SYDE specific courses

### Student Opinions

- What are the opinions of the graduating class? What were their alternatives?

## Employment Prospects/Where do we apply our skills?

### Where do SYDES work? (& Is it all Software?) - Co-op focus

- What work do sydes do?
- What job prospects are there?
- Co-op progression, earnings, etc
- (What careers does SYDE prepare me for?)
- Can pursue almost any type of career: finance, sustainability, UI/UX, data science, product/project management, etc

### Design Projects/Student Creations

- Show off capstone projects, student design projects, clubs students have started or that SYDE has heavy involvement in

### Life after Graduation

- The class of 2017 profile would be sweet here for showing off a mix of full time positions, entrepreneurial ventures, non-profit work, etc
- Show off companies that have come from systems: D2L, Miovision, Pebble, etc

## What Next?

### What should I do in the summer before?

- Enjoy your summer with your high school friends, and the last summer off you will likely have
- Maybe learn some programming basics
- Get your resume ready!

### How can I meet current students?

- Open houses. Shadow days. Etc.
- Have contact information for some representative SYDE ambassadors
